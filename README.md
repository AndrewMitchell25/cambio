# Cambio

This project implements a distributed version of the card game Cambio and was created for the Distributed Systems class at the University of Notre Dame by Andrew Mitchell and Kyle Phan. 

To run it, first start a server instance with `python server.py <server_name> <player_num>`. For each player, run a client instance with `python client.py <server_name>`. If asked for multiple inputs, separate them with a space. Have fun!

This project was written in Python 3.12.
